Yes, the solution uses a **two-pointer technique**, even though it's slightly specialized. Here's how it fits the two-pointer paradigm:

---

### What is the Two-Pointer Technique?

The two-pointer technique typically involves using two variables (or pointers) to traverse or manipulate an array. These pointers might:

1. Move in the same direction.
2. Move toward each other.
3. Have independent roles based on the logic.

In this case, the solution uses:

- **Pointer `i`:** The "fast pointer" that iterates through every element of the array.
- **Pointer `j`:** The "slow pointer" that tracks the position where the next non-zero element should go.

---

### How It Works Here:

1. **Pointer `i`:**

   - Iterates over every element in the array.
   - Finds non-zero elements to process.
   - Ensures all elements are checked (so it functions as the main iterator).

2. **Pointer `j`:**
   - Tracks the location of the next position for non-zero elements.
   - Moves forward only when a non-zero element is encountered (after swapping).
   - Ensures that non-zero elements are placed at the correct indices, starting from the front of the array.

---

### Why Is This Two Pointers?

- **Two distinct roles:**

  - `i` scans the array and determines what to process.
  - `j` ensures non-zero elements are arranged correctly, separate from the scanning process.

- **They operate simultaneously:**
  - `i` and `j` may be at different positions at any given time.
  - The interaction between the two ensures zeroes are "skipped" and naturally pushed to the end.

### Visualization:

For an array `[0, 1, 0, 3, 12]`:

| Step | `i` (Fast Pointer) | `j` (Slow Pointer) | Array State        |
| ---- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Init | -                  | 0                  | `[0, 1, 0, 3, 12]` |
| 1    | 0                  | 0                  | `[0, 1, 0, 3, 12]` |
| 2    | 1                  | 0 -> 1             | `[1, 0, 0, 3, 12]` |
| 3    | 2                  | 1                  | `[1, 0, 0, 3, 12]` |
| 4    | 3                  | 1 -> 2             | `[1, 3, 0, 0, 12]` |
| 5    | 4                  | 2 -> 3             | `[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]` |

### Benefits of the Two-Pointer Technique Here:

- **In-Place Modification:** No extra memory is used, and zeroes are moved implicitly.
- **Single Pass Efficiency:** The solution works in \(O(n)\) time complexity.

This is a classic **two-pointer technique** adapted for moving zeroes to the end. ðŸ˜Š
